# Rock Paper Scissors

Lightweight web version of Rock Paper Scissors (MVP).

Run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. (Optional) install `live-server` and run `live-server` from the project directory for auto-reload.

Files:

- `index.html` - main UI
- `css/styles.css` - styles
- `js/game.js` - game logic
- `assets/` - placeholder SVGs (replace with your art as desired)

Notes:

- Light themed, no animations or sounds for MVP.
- To change art, replace files in `assets/` with your images (keep filenames `rock.svg`, `paper.svg`, `scissors.svg`).

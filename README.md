# Rock Paper Scissors

Lightweight web version of Rock Paper Scissors (MVP).

Run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. (Optional) install `live-server` and run `live-server` from the project directory for auto-reload.

Files:

- `index.html` - main UI
- `css/styles.css` - styles
- `js/game.js` - game logic
- `assets/` - placeholder SVGs (replace with your art as desired)

Notes:

- Light themed, no animations or sounds for MVP.
- To change art, replace files in `assets/` with your images (keep filenames `rock.svg`, `paper.svg`, `scissors.svg`).


documentation:
I want to make a very simple rock paper scissors game and i need picture references to give to vscode agent. So i want the front page to say “rock paper scissors” at the center and “play” below it. But i also want the option to have the x button at top right to quit the game. Once play is pressed i want the view to be centered with “bot” on top row, below it 3 suqares/buttons that are grayed out and smaller because they are not interactable. Below those 3 i want another set of the same squares. These squares represent the rock paper scissor options with the emojis inside them. Below those 3 i want to be “you” written to represent the player. Once the player picks a button it shows victory/defeat, and “try again”. Those are the images i need for reference. 

-pasted the images to vscode plan. tweaked it a little.
-midway had to specify to use c#, not python.
